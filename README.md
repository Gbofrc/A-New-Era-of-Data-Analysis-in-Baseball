<p>This is Aaron Judge. Judge is one of the physically largest players in Major League Baseball standing 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall and weighing 282 pounds (128 kg). He also hit the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/aaron-judge-sets-statcast-exit-velocity-record/c-235640846">hardest home run</a> ever recorded. How do we know this? <strong>Statcast</strong>.</p>
<p>Statcast is a state-of-the-art tracking system that uses high-resolution cameras and radar equipment to measure the precise location and movement of baseballs and baseball players. Introduced in 2015 to all 30 major league ballparks, Statcast data is revolutionizing the game. Teams are engaging in an "arms race" of data analysis, hiring analysts left and right in an attempt to gain an edge over their competition. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rOKGKhQe8U">video</a> describing the system is incredible.</p>
<p><strong>In this notebook</strong>, we're going to wrangle, analyze, and visualize Statcast data to compare Mr. Judge and another (extremely large) teammate of his.
